# Discord-Notification-Manger 
Intercepts and manages how users receive pings on Discord.

# Supports multiple users that each can:
- Add channels from which pings will be moderated
- Set the minimum interval between pings recieved from those channels
- Blacklist certain users' messages from being able to ping you

# Main Idea
When a conversation starts in one of the channels added to your user profile, you will be notified once upon the first message sent, and then you will not be nmotified again until the intervl you set lapses. This allows you to be aware of converstaions happening in a particualr channel without being overwhelmed with notifications.
